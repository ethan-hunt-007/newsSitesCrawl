Crawls some specified news sites for a particular name and checks for others people's name in the scraped data.

Import the functions in the news_bot.py and call them with required name to query in those news sites.
Some sites have been crawled using requests and others with selenium.


The news_matrix_fill.py is used to create matrix combination of appeareance of names of two or more 
people together in some news on those sites and to show the count and links for those news.
